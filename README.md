# PHP stock market web scraping
Version: 1.0

Web scraping is a very useful method to collect data from outside sources and bring it to your application. Thereâ€™s a lot of ways to do that and in this repo there's an example with a simple PHP library called PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser.

The library is available on SourceForge:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/simplehtmldom/files/simplehtmldom/1.9.1/

I hope that this code helps you.
